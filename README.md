# Electronics

I’ve completed over 100 hardware and software projects, covering embedded systems, IoT, and AI applications. I maintain a well-equipped personal lab with over 100 microcontroller development boards, 10+ single-board computers (SBCs), and more than 200 sensors and modules. My setup includes essential tools like an oscilloscope, VNA, power supplies, and QDAQ, enabling advanced prototyping and testing.

I’ve designed over 50 custom PCBs for personal projects (excluding revisions), driven by a strong desire to continuously improve my skills and deepen my understanding of electronics and system design.
Through these hands-on projects, I’ve gained expert-level skills in soldering, debugging, and small-scale manufacturing, allowing me to bring complex hardware systems from concept to fully working prototypes with confidence and precision.

The picture shows only a small portion of my lab. Most of the equipment, boards, and sensors are neatly stored in plastic containers for organization and accessibility.
